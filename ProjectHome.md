# MDA Tools with transformation contracts #

A transformation contract is a set of invariants that specify a relationship between a source and a target metamodel. A transformation contract is an executable specification when described in OCL and the model transformation implementation interacts with an OCL interpreter. With such an architecture, a tranformation contract becomes a live assertion (or a conjunction of live assertions) that may be checked every time a model transformation is executed. Both tools below implement the concept of transformation contracts.
