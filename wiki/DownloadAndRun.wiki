= Introduction =

In this page we describe how to run our tool, the transformer, and documents for a better understanding.


= Download and Run =

First, you have to download the dependencies:

* [http://www.slf4j.org/ Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J)]
  * slf4j-api-1.5.11.jar - [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/slf4j-nop-1.5.11.jar Download]
  * slf4j-nop-1.5.11.jar - [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/slf4j-api-1.5.11.jar Download]

* [http://secumltoaac.sourceforge.net/ XEOS (eXtended Eye OCL Software)]
  * XEOS.jar - [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/XEOS-1.0.jar Download]
  Obs.: This version is customized for this application. Please use this one.

* Transformer-base
  * transformer-base-1.0.jar - [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/transformer-base-1.0.jar Download]

* Transformer
  * transformer-1.0.jar - [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/transformer-1.0.jar Download]

`*``*``*`
_*If you want the source-code, download the version 1.0 [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/umltoejb-src-1.0.jar here] or [http://code.google.com/p/umltoejb/source/checkout checkout it]. We use [http://netbeans.org/ Netbeans] to develop this tool.*_

After this, you can use these files and test the transformer by yourself :)

= Download, Compile and Run =

If you want to compile this project:

*1) Get the source code:*
  * Download it [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/umltoejb-src-1.0.jar here]
  * Checkout it [http://code.google.com/p/umltoejb/source/checkout here]

*2) Compile using:*
  * [http://netbeans.org/ Netbeans]. We use this IDE to develop this tool so we recommend it. If you use an older version, please install the Maven's plugin.
  * [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven]. This project uses Maven so just run this command in the console: mvn compile
  * javac. Use the following commands to compile (run it in the 'umltoejb' folder) (In this case, YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ALL SLF4J DEPENDENCIES and put these jar in the 'umltoejb' folder):
    {{{
            Under contruction.
    }}}

*3) Test it were you want!* 
The next version (it is already in tests) will read a XMI to load the UML diagram but, for this version (1.0) you need to insert the diagram's elements hardcoded. To help you, see the folder 'interface-grafica'. In this project, it use some diagrams and it can help you building yours while the XMI version is in tests.  The project 'interface-grafica' allows you to query, using OCL, your models so enjoy :)

= Javadoc =

In development but you can download what we have documented in the release 1.0 [http://umltoejb.googlecode.com/files/javadocs-1.0.zip here].
